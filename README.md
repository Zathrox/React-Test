This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React-Test

After creating the initial React-App, I targeted what I deemed the hardest part of the challenge first, which was the ability to fetch and use data from an API, I researched and looks at various materials on how to do this and then using a combination of Hexbox and RandomUser, I was able to figure out how to get, store and use data from these APIs, which then prompted me to create a "employees section" for the page and add the button functionality that makes use of the Hexbot and changes colours on the page.

After that, I focused on creating the profile page by creating the state I needed for the other tasks, once that was working I then focused on adding the additional functionality to the profile page by manipulating the state with forms and functions to update and change the values and fields.

While doing this, I was continuously adding to, tweaking and expanding the linked CSS properties to create a consistent look and feel to the design of the page, inline with the current website.

Overall, I'm pretty satisfed with what I produced in such a small space of time, there are a few niggley problems I never got around to fixing or implementing, such as the text for Interests/Intro kept on sticking to the left side of the element and wouldn't centralise or how to keep the employee list following you as you scrolled up and down, so there is plenty of room for improvement and learning but for spending around 10 hours on it, without knowing React in the slightest, I'm pleased with this!
