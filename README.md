This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React-Test

After creating the initial React-App, I targeted what I deemed the hardest part of the challenge first, which was the ability to fetch and use data from an API, I researched and looks at various materials on how to do this and then using a combination of Hexbox and RandomUser, I was able to figure out how to get, store and use data from these APIs, which then prompted me to create a "employees section" for the page and add the button functionality that makes use of the Hexbot and changes colours on the page.

After that, I focused on creating the profile page by creating the state I needed for the other tasks, once that was working I then focused on adding the additional functionality to the profile page by manipulating the state with forms and functions to update and change the values and fields.

While doing this, I was continuously adding to, tweaking and expanding the linked CSS properties to create a consistent look and feel to the design of the page, inline with the current website.
